# SEI
Structural Entities Extraction and Patient Indications Incorporation for Chest X-ray Report Generation

The automated generation of imaging reports proves invaluable in alleviating the workload of radiologists. A clinically applicable reports generation algorithm should demonstrate its effectiveness in producing reports that accurately describe radiology findings and attend to patient-specific indications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, **S**tructural **E**ntities extraction and patient indications **I**ncorporation (SEI) for chest X-ray report generation. Specifically, we employ a structural entities extraction (SEE) approach to eliminate presentation-style vocabulary in reports and improve the quality of factual entity sequences. This reduces the noise in the following cross-modal alignment module by aligning X-ray images with factual entity sequences in reports, thereby enhancing the precision of cross-modal alignment and further aiding the model in gradient-free retrieval of similar historical cases. Subsequently, we propose a cross-modal fusion network to integrate information from X-ray images, similar historical cases, and patient-specific indications. This process allows the text decoder to attend to discriminative features of X-ray images, assimilate historical diagnostic information from similar cases, and understand the examination intention of patients. This, in turn, assists in triggering the text decoder to produce high-quality reports. Experiments conducted on MIMIC-CXR validate the superiority of SEI over state-of-the-art approaches on both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics.

## Requirements

- `torch==2.1.2+cu118`
- `transformers==4.23.1`

## Reproducibility on MIMIC-CXR (SEI-1)

### Structural entities extraction (SEE) approach

1. Config RadGraph environment based on `knowledge_encoder/factual_serialization.py`


   ===================environmental setting=================
   
    Basic Setup (One-time activity)

   a. Clone the DYGIE++ repository from [here](https://github.com/dwadden/dygiepp). This repository is managed by Wadden et al., authors of the paper [Entity, Relation, and Event Extraction with Contextualized Span Representations](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1585.pdf).
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dwadden/dygiepp.git
    ```
    
   b. Navigate to the root of repo in your system and use the following commands to set the conda environment:
    ```bash
   conda create --name dygiepp python=3.7
   conda activate dygiepp
   cd dygiepp
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   conda develop .   # Adds DyGIE to your PYTHONPATH
   ```

   c. Activate the conda environment:
    
    ```bash
   conda activate dygiepp
    ```
   
2. Config `radgraph_path` and `ann_path` in `knowledge_encoder/see.py`. `annotation.json`, can be obtained from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DS6NYirOXQf8qYieSVMvqNwuOlgAbM_E/view?usp=sharing). Note that you can apply with your license of [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/).

3. Run the `knowledge_encoder/see.py` to extract factual entity sequence for each report.
   
4. Finally, the `annotation.json` becomes `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen.json` that is identical to `new_ann_file_name` variable in `see.py`


### Conducting the first stage (i.e., training cross-modal alignment module)

1. Run `bash pretrain_mimic_cxr.sh` to pretrain a model on the MIMIC-CXR data (Note that the `mimic_cxr_ann_path` is `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen.json`).

### Similar historical cases retrieval for each sample

1. Config `--load` argument in `pretrain_inference_mimic_cxr.sh`. Note that the argument is the pre-trained model from the first stage.

2. Run `bash pretrain_inference_mimic_cxr.sh` to retrieve similar historical cases for each sample, forming `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen_best_reports_keywords_20.json` (i.e., the `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen.json` becomes this `*.json` file).

### Conducting the second stage (i.e., training report generation module)


1. Extract and preprocess the `indication section` in the radiology report.

   a. Config `ann_path` and `report_dir` in `knowledge_encoder/preprocessing_indication_section.py`, and its value is `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen_best_reports_keywords_20.json`. 
      Note that `report_dir` can be downloaded from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/).
   
   b. Run `knowledge_encoder/preprocessing_indication_section.py`, forming `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen_best_reports_keywords_20_all_components_with_fs_v0227.json`


2. Config `--load` argument in `finetune_mimic_cxr.sh`. Note that the argument is the pre-trained model from the first stage. Furthermore, `mimic_cxr_ann_path` is `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen_best_reports_keywords_20_all_components_with_fs_v0227.json`

3. Download these checkpoints. Notably, the `chexbert.pth` and `radgraph` are used to calculate CE metrics, and `bert-base-uncased` and `scibert\_scivocab\_uncased ` are pre-trained models for cross-modal fusion network and text encoder. Then put these checkpoints in the same local dir (e.g., "/home/data/checkpoints"), and configure the `--ckpt_zoo_dir /home/data/checkpoints` argument in `finetune_mimic_cxr.sh`

4. Run `bash finetune_mimic_cxr.sh` to generate reports based on similar historical cases.


### Test 

1. You must download the medical images, their corresponding reports (i.e., `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen_best_reports_keywords_20_all_components_with_fs_v0227.json`),  and checkpoints (i.e., `SEI-1-finetune-model-best.pth`) in Section Datasets and Section Checkpoints, respectively.

2. Config `--load` and `--mimic_cxr_ann_path`arguments in `test_mimic_cxr.sh`

3. Run `bash test_mimic_cxr.sh` to generate reports based on similar historical cases.

4. Results on MIMIC-CXR are presented as follows:
