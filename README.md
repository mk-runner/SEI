## Requirements

- `torch==2.1.2+cu118`
- `transformers==4.23.1`
- `torchvision==0.16.2+cu118`
- Due to the specific environment of RadGraph,  please refer to `knowledge_encoder/factual serialization. py` for the environment of the structural entities approach.


## Checkpoints

You can download checkpoints of FSE as follows:

- For `MIMIC-CXR`, you can download checkpoints from [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/15SW1k3xZ57S06FUeqpclAA) (its code is `MK13`) and [huggingface ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/MK-runner/SEI/upload/main).

## MIMIC-CXR Datasets

- For `MIMIC-CXR`, you can download medical images from [here](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/).

- You can download `medical reports` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iWdFINSAJ7F97I4rTGddIziJAb-1sL3l/view?usp=drive_link). Note that you can apply with your license of [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/), and its `toy case` is in `knowledge_encoder/case.json`

## Reproducibility on MIMIC-CXR (SEI-1)

### Structural entities extraction (SEE) approach

1. Config RadGraph environment based on `knowledge_encoder/factual_serialization.py`
   ===================environmental setting=================
    Basic Setup (One-time activity)

   a. Clone the DYGIE++ repository from [here](https://github.com/dwadden/dygiepp). This repository is managed by Wadden et al., authors of the paper [Entity, Relation, and Event Extraction with Contextualized Span Representations](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1585.pdf).
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dwadden/dygiepp.git
    ```
   b. Navigate to the root of repo in your system and use the following commands to set the conda environment:
    ```bash
   conda create --name dygiepp python=3.7
   conda activate dygiepp
   cd dygiepp
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   conda develop .   # Adds DyGIE to your PYTHONPATH
   ```
   c. Activate the conda environment:
    
    ```bash
   conda activate dygiepp
    ```
   
2. Config `radgraph_model_path` and `ann_path` in `knowledge_encoder/see.py`. The former can be downloaded from [here](https://physionet.org/content/radgraph/1.0.0/), and the latter, `annotation.json`, can be obtained from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DS6NYirOXQf8qYieSVMvqNwuOlgAbM_E/view?usp=sharing). Note that you can apply with your license of [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/).
3. Run the `knowledge_encoder/see.py` to extract factual entity sequence for each report.
4. Finally, the `annotation.json` becomes `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen.json` that is identical to `new_ann_file_name` variable in `see.py`

Notably,`chexbert.pth` can download from [here](https://stanfordmedicine.app.box.com/s/c3stck6w6dol3h36grdc97xoydzxd7w9). `distilbert-base-uncased` can download from [here](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased). `bert-base-uncased` can download from [here](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased). `radgraph` can download from [here](https://physionet.org/content/radgraph/1.0.0/). `scibert_scivocab_uncased` can download from [here](https://huggingface.co/allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased). 

### Conducting the first stage (i.e., training cross-modal alignment module)

Run `bash pretrain_mimic_cxr.sh` to pretrain a model on the MIMIC-CXR data (Note that the `mimic_cxr_ann_path` is `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen.json`).

### Similar historical cases retrieval for each sample

1. Config `--load` argument in `pretrain_inference_mimic_cxr.sh`. Note that the argument is the pre-trained model from the first stage.
2. Run `bash pretrain_inference_mimic_cxr.sh` to retrieve similar historical cases for each sample, forming `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen_best_reports_keywords_20.json` (i.e., the `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen.json` becomes this `*.json` file).

### Conducting the second stage (i.e., training report generation module)

1. Extract and preprocess the `indication section` in the radiology report.
   a. Config `ann_path` and `report_dir` in `knowledge_encoder/preprocessing_indication_section.py`, and its value is `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen_best_reports_keywords_20.json`. 
      Note that `report_dir` can be downloaded from [here](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/). 
   b. Run `knowledge_encoder/preprocessing_indication_section.py`, forming `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen_best_reports_keywords_20_all_components_with_fs_v0227.json`
2. Config `--load` argument in `finetune_mimic_cxr.sh`. Note that the argument is the pre-trained model from the first stage. Furthermore, `mimic_cxr_ann_path` is `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen_best_reports_keywords_20_all_components_with_fs_v0227.json`
3. Run `bash finetune_mimic_cxr.sh` to generate reports based on similar historical cases.


### Test 

1. You must download the medical images, their corresponding reports (i.e., `mimic_cxr_annotation_sen_best_reports_keywords_20_all_components_with_fs_v0227.json`),  and checkpoints (i.e., `SEI-1-finetune-model-best.pth`) in Section Datasets and Section Checkpoints, respectively.

2. Config `--load` and `--mimic_cxr_ann_path`arguments in `test_mimic_cxr.sh`

3. Run `bash test_mimic_cxr.sh` to generate reports based on similar historical cases.

4. Results on MIMIC-CXR are presented as follows:

5. Next, the code for this project will be streamlined.
